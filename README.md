This is one of the challenges I completed from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100).
A landing page with single introductory section designed with HTML and CSS.
I took on the challenge to refresh my CSS skills- layout, positioning and building out a responsive website.

## My process

      -  Day 1: Create mobile design (HTML, CSS)
      -  Day 2: Create desktop design (HTML, CSS)

I started with the mobile design first, media queries, and navbar to make sure everything is responsive before I start working on anything else. 

Secondally, I did the Desktop version. I use pure CSS to give me more freedom to fix anything as I please.
